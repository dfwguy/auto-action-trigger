# Health checks (`actions/node_health.sh`)

The script runs each check, writes output to `logs/<node>/<check-name>`, and
diffs against the baseline in `valid-config/default/`. Any mismatch appends to a
`reason` string. After all checks, it either sets the node `IDLE` (no failures)
or `DOWN` with the accumulated reason.

A `refresh` sentinel file in `logs/<node>/` must exist for the health script to
run — this is what prevents redundant re-checks on every monitoring cycle. Use
`node-health-refresh.sh` to set it.

`health-check.sh` summarizes which checks are failing across the whole cluster,
grouped by check. `sync-check.sh <node>` then diffs one node's output against the
baseline for each check named in its drain reason, which is usually the fastest
way to see why that node was taken down.

The reason string is not simply a list of check names — `append_reason` writes
`Check BIOS` for the `bios` check, `cuuid` for `nvidia-smi-cuuid`, and
`dmesg-xid` carries its own output into the reason. `health-check.sh` matches
reason text against the known check names for that reason; anything reading the
reason field needs to do the same.
